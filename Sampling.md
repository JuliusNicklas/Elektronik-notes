Sampling period $T_s$

Sampling frequency $f_s = T_s^{-1}$

$f_s > 2 \cdot f_{sig}$ is acceptable. $f_{sig}$ is the max frequency of any signal in the signal. At least this frequency allows for signal reconstruction. Called [Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem)
