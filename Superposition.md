The principle of superposition:
In linear circuit: total response can be determined by summing the response of **independent** sources. 

Linear function of individual responses.

$v_x = Sum( N , n=1 ,  A_n V_n )$

# Using Superposition in Circuit Analysis
1. Calculate contribution of independent sources.
	1.  Turn of other sources
2.
