Switches have 2 states, on and off.
Electronic or physical
It acts as a resistor with variable resistance.

# Electronic switch
In an electronic switch the variable resistance is controlled by

### Ideal electronic switch
Physically impossible. Has infinite resistance when control voltage is 0, has 0 resistance when it has any control voltage applied. 
This is impossible in reality because:
- resistance cannot be infinite or 0
- There is some delay between control voltage appliance, and resistance dropping.
- There is some [[Parasitic Capacitance]], causing the resistance to gradually drop.
