Resistance in frequency domain.

Denoted $Z$ or $Z(s)$
$s = 1/\tau + j\omega$ is complex frequency
$Y(s) = Z(s)^{-1}$
$V(s) = Z(s)I(s)$
$𝐼(𝑠) = 𝑌(𝑠)𝑉(𝑠)$,

### Impedance of Resistor
$Z_R = R$

$|Z_R(j w)| = R$
$\angle Z_R(j w) = 0$

### Impedance of Capacitor
$Z_C = 1/Cs$

$|Z_R(j w)| = \frac{1}{wC}$
$\angle Z_R(j w) = -\pi/2$
^ This means that it operates on the frequency domain

### Impedance of Inductor
$Z_L = Ls$

$|Z_R(j w)| = wL$
$\angle Z_R(j w) = +\pi/2$
