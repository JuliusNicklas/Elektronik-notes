Capacitance: $C = \varepsilon_r \varepsilon_0 A / d$ 

Capacitance $C$ is measured in Farad $F$.


Initial condition is voltage or power stored in capacitor at time 0.

### Series of capacitors
Equivalent capacitance $C_{eq}$:
$$
V = \frac{I}{s} \sum_{k=1}^N \frac{1}{C_k} = \frac{I}{s} \frac{1}{C_{eq}} 
$$
$$
C_{eq} = \dfrac{1}{\sum_{k=1}^{N}\frac{1}{C_k}}
$$
Equivalent capacitance is the inverse of the sum of the inverse capacitances. 
Exactly like with **parallel** resistances!
 
### Parallel capacitors
Equivalent to adding the capacitance of all capacitors
$C_{eq}=\sum_{k=1}^{N}C_k$

Parallel connection of capacitors with different charge leads to the higher charged capacitors discharging and destroying the capacitors.

### Average power of Capacitor
- Energy $W(t_1)= \frac{1}{2}CV_1^2$
- 
- Average Power with periodic chargr, discharge $P_{avg} = f_{clk}CV_1^2$
