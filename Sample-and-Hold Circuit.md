Circuit for [[sampling]]
Has a [[switch]] and a capacitor. When the switch is on it samples, when switch is of the capacitor holds.
Has 3 components:
- Sampling [[capacitor]] $C_s$
- Switch SW
- Voltage source $V_a$ which is the analog signal

2 phases:

### Nonidealities (error sources)
- Clock feedthrough
- Nonlinearities 

Holding error is caused by capacitor discharge during holding
