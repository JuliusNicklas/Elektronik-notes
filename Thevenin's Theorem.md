Any linear circuit can be modeled as a voltage source $V_{Th}$ (Thevenin voltage) in series with a resistor $R_{Th}$ (Theveninv resistance).
$V_{AB} = R_{Th} I_{test} + V_{Th}$

### Determine $V_{Th}, R_{Th}$
Model must always match networks response.
Use [[Superposition]]:
$V_{AB} = R_{Th} I_{test} + V_{Th}$
- When open circuit (KVL) ($I_{test} = 0$): $V_{AB} = V_{Th}$
- When all independent Voltage sources are off: $V_{AB} = R_{Th} I_{test}$
