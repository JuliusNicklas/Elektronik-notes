A diode is a self controlled [[Switch]], which means that the input is also the control. The control voltage is the same as the voltage across the diode.

Let's current through only one way, and only when voltage is higher than the threshold value. 

In a diode the voltage across the device $v_D \geq V_T \approx 0.7V$

### Physical construction
A diode is made by using p- and n-type [[Semiconductor]]. The current can only flow from p through n.
